Bank is a money repository which helps customers to deposit, withdraw and transfer funds. Earlier in order to perform any banking task, customer was required to be present physically. So it is not possible for everyone to go bank, stand in queue, and do all the transactions. In order to overcome that we have proposed online banking. It saves time, money and resources. Using this we can do any kind of transaction from any corner of the earth within a short period of time.This makes the user friendly and provides more flexibility. The primary goal of this Internet Banking (Online Banking) is to provide thecustomer, a flexible, simple, and high efficient banking transaction without wasting their valuable time in coming to the banks for doing transaction processing.</b></p>
